## Product Overview

CreatorX3 establishes a blockchain base for X.com. Users can seamlessly log in via their X.com accounts, and our system employs MPC wallet technology to generate a new wallet for each user under the hood. This ensures that users do not need to import any private keys on our platform while still enabling them to interact with the blockchain.

## Features

### MPC Wallet Integration

CreatorX3 leverages Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallet technology to generate new wallets for users upon login via X.com. This eliminates the need for users to import or manage private keys manually, streamlining the onboarding process and enhancing security.

### Task-Based Onboarding

To facilitate user engagement and incentivize participation, CreatorX3 implements a task-based system. Users are required to complete basic tasks to earn $BST tokens, which are essential for account creation and interaction with the platform. Tasks include inviting new users, sharing content on X.com, and binding Discord accounts to prevent bot activity.

### XRC20 and XRC721 Tokens

In response to the growing popularity of BRC20 tokens, CreatorX3 introduces its own XRC20 and XRC721 tokens. These tokens are designed to attract hot traffic and promote user growth. The first XRC20 token, launched with a fair minting policy, prevents misuse by limiting each X.com user to one minting opportunity. Additionally, XRC721 tokens will soon be available, providing users with access to unique functionalities on the Moonbeam chain.

### UNI-Bridge Integration

CreatorX3 features a UNI-Bridge that enables users to seamlessly transfer USDC tokens from other chains into the Moonbeam chain. This bridge facilitates interoperability between different blockchain networks, allowing users to leverage the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications across platforms.

## Hackathon Development

During the hackathon, we focused on building a simplified version of X.com with on-chain logic. We also implemented growth hacking strategies to attract new users and promote engagement. Since its launch, CreatorX3 has issued over 5500 tasks and minted nearly 40,000 $BSTEntropy tokens. Additionally, our XRC20 and XRC721 modules have attracted over 3000 X.com users and minted millions of tokens.
